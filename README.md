# Password-Generator
FE Bootcamp W5 Challenge

## Overview
In this project, a password generator is built to generate a password with the following criteria:
    * At least 8 characters but no more than 128.
    * Include at least one of the Character types below
      * Lowercase
      * Uppercase
      * Numeric
      * Special characters ($@%&*, etc)

## Functionalities:
User is prompted to input the length of the password and select the type of characters to be included. 

The code validates if the input is a number first, then validate that at least on type of character is selected before generating password using a random function.
